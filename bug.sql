In SQL, a common but subtle error arises when using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses together for pagination.  If the `OFFSET` value becomes very large, the database might take a significant amount of time to process the query, even if the `LIMIT` is small. This is because the database still needs to skip over the large `OFFSET` before fetching the desired results.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM large_table LIMIT 10 OFFSET 1000000;
```

This query could be very slow, even though it's only requesting 10 rows.  The database engine has to scan through the first 1,000,000 rows before it can return the results.
